## Origins and Earth Systems

### Evidence worksheet 01 "Prokaryotes: The Unseen Majority"

#### Learning objectives:

* Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.

#### General questions:

* What were the main questions being asked?

* What were the primary methodological approaches used?

* Summarize the main results or findings.

* Do new questions arise from the results?

* Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (e.g. did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?

### Evidence worksheet 02 “Life and the Evolution of Earth’s Atmosphere”

#### Learning objectives:

* Comment on the emergence of microbial life and the evolution of Earth systems.

#### Prompt

* **Key events in the evolution of Earth systems as an interactive timeline.**

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Create marks on the time series with a vector. This holds the "y-value" for the timeline, which we are using as 0 for this application.
tics <-rep(0,14)

# Create another vector the same length of the time series tics that holds the discrete dates to be displayed on the timeline. List the dates as a factor of millions of years ago (billions are a thousand million years).
Million.years.ago<-c(4600,4500,4400,4200,3800,3750,3500,3000,2700,2200,2100,1300,0.550,0)

# Create a vector that holds the text of the events that correspond to the dates that you provided in the Million.years.ago vector.
events<-c("Solar system formed","formation of moon giving Earth spin and tilt, day/night cycles & seasons","formation of oceans and early atmosphere","Darwinian threshold",
          "prokaryotic cells, Rubisco, stable sea chemistry, halted meteorite bombardment","photosynthesis","cyanobacteria","eukaryotic cells",
          "great oxidation event, Red Beds","first snowball Earth","appearance of multicellular life", "animals","humans","today")

# Create a vector that holds the names of the epoch to which the events you've recorded correspond.
epoch<-c(rep("Hadean",4),rep("Archaen",5),rep("Proterozoic",3),rep("Phanerozoic",2))

# Merge the vectors you created into a dataframe.
ddd<-data.frame(tics,Million.years.ago,events,epoch)

# Load the plotly and shiny libraries; you'll need this for the plotting later.
library(plotly)
library(shiny)

# Define some axis parameters for the interactive plotly plot you're building. I want this to look like a timeline, so I want to effectively erase the y-axis.
ay <- list(
  title = "",
  zeroline = FALSE,
  showline = FALSE,
  showticklabels = FALSE,
  showgrid = FALSE
)

# Define the axis title parameters for the plot. You will use this  and the ay variable you defined previously in the next command.
ax <- list(
  title = "Million years ago"
)

# Make your interactive plot:
plot_ly(ddd, x = ~Million.years.ago, y = ddd$tics, type = "scatter",
  # Hover text:
  text = ~paste(events),
  color = ~epoch
) %>%
  layout(title="Evolutionary Development of Earth", xaxis = ax, yaxis = ay)
```

* **Dominant physical and chemical characteristics of Earth systems at
waypoints.**

Select an epoch from the dropdown to see a summary of the predominant physical and chemical characteristics of Earth at the time.
